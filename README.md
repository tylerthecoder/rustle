# Rustle

Play wordle and nerdle in the terminal.

## TODO

- Add Multiply and Divide to the equation gen
  - The challenge here is the output of mul(a,b) is not continuous like add(a,b) is
  - Might just have to skip the times where it messes up because of this
- Turn into an executable (rustle) with options `-n` to play nerdle `-l` for length of word/equation
- Cache some of the functions. Output bounds of a equation structure is always the same.
  This may only need to be done if the program is noticeably slow.
